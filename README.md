# Image Classification of Animals

Objective:
Build a system that can identify the animal in a given image.

Dataset:
This dataset contains 15 folders of images of dimensions: 224 x 224 x 3, suitable for image
classification. Each folder represents a class corresponding to the folder name.
Classes in the dataset:
● Bear
● Bird
● Cat
● Cow
● Deer
● Dog
● Dolphin
● Elephant
● Giraffe
● Horse
● Kangaroo
● Lion
● Panda
● Tiger
● Zebra

Solution:
-->A deep learning model to classify images across 15 animal classes using a dataset of 224x224 pixel images. 

-->Leveraged pre-trained CNN architectures (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet50) with fine-tuning for improved accuracy, achieving reliable real-time predictions on new images.

-->Applied data augmentation, transfer learning, and model optimization to ensure robustness and efficiency, resulting in high accuracy across all classes.
