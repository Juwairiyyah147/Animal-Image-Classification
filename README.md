# Animal-Image-Classification
-->A deep learning model to classify images across 15 animal classes using a dataset of 224x224 pixel images. 
-->Leveraged pre-trained CNN architectures (e.g., MobileNetV2, ResNet50) with fine-tuning for improved accuracy, achieving reliable real-time predictions on new images.
-->Applied data augmentation, transfer learning, and model optimization to ensure robustness and efficiency, resulting in high accuracy across all classes.
